# Legal notice
So, as you know unless you dump your own ROM from your own game cartridge, you're kinda breaking copyright rules, but that hasn't stopped anyone before now has it? :P But because copyright laws & blah blah blah (Because I don't need Nintendo going after my ass) I can't provide any ROMs here, but hey if you're smart (or at-least know how to find what you're looking for) you should be able to find them without too much trouble.
